          <p>
            The objective of this study was to analyze a dataset of 270,000
            patients with reported heart disease to identify correlations
            between various metrics and cardiac health. Through structured data
            analysis, key demographic and behavioral factors are investigated to
            uncover potential risk contributors. This research also served as an
            illustration of practical application of SQL and data visualization
            techniques (created Tableau Dashboard in correlation), advancing
            data analysis skills in the field of cardiovascular health.

          <p>
            The goal of this project is to showcase database management, SQL,
            data analysis, and dashboard building while delivering a tailored
            solution for a new clothing brand redefining 90s aesthetics, called
            Heirloom. Designed a database from scratch to provide tools
            necessary for order tracking, inventory management, and customer
            insight, etc.

          <p>
            Supply chain analytics plays a crucial role in data-driven
            decision-making across industries like manufacturing, retail,
            healthcare, and logistics. It involves collecting, analyzing, and
            interpreting data on the flow of products and services from
            suppliers to customers. This project focuses on optimizing supply
            chain operations, including logistics and inventory management,
            through data-driven insights. Using SQL, I analyze data related to
            order fulfillment rates, warehouse efficiency, and transportation
            costs to enhance supply chain performance and reduce operational
            bottlenecks. ShoeFly is performing an A/B Test. They have two
            different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as
            well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to
            know how the two ads are performing on each of the different
            platforms on each day of the week.

          <span class="image main"><img src="images/main1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            I build a database schema that could be used to organize an
            inventory of mechanical parts. The schema will keep track of all the
            parts, their manaufacturer, category, location in storeroom,
            available inventory, and other relevant information.
